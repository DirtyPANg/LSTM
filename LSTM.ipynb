    "This project is a text classification task, conducted on the Kaggle platform using the NLP Disaster Tweets dataset. The goal is to build a machine learning model that can accurately classify whether a tweet is related to a real disaster or not. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset consists of a training set with approximately 7,600 labeled tweets and a test set with approximately 3,200 unlabeled tweets. The tweets are preprocessed and combined into a single string, which is then tokenized and padded to a fixed length. \n",
    "\n",
    "The model used for classification is a recurrent neural network (RNN) with a long short-term memory (LSTM) layer. The input to the model is a sequence of tokenized and padded tweets, which are fed through the embedding layer and into the LSTM layer. The LSTM layer is followed by a dense layer with a ReLU activation function, dropout regularization, and a final output layer with a sigmoid activation function to produce binary classification predictions. \n",
    "\n",
    "The model is trained using the binary cross-entropy loss function and the Adam optimizer. The accuracy of the model is evaluated on a validation set, and the final predictions are made on the test set. The accuracy of the predictions is calculated using the F1 score."
